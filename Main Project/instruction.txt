                On-flight instructions
                ------------------------


                1. For the entire duration of the flight, passengers must ensure hygiene 
                   and sanitization and should minimise face-to-face interaction.
                2. They should attempt to minimise the use of the lavatory and any 
                   non-essential movement must be avoided.
                3. Queuing at the lavatory would not be allowed and only one attendant 
                   would be permitted for children and elderly.
                4. While water bottles would be available at the gallery area or on the seats, 
                   the airlines will not provide any meals.
                5. Consumption of any eatables inside the aircraft would be prohibited.
                6. No newspapers or magazines will be available inside the cabin, 
                   and no on-board sale of any kind would take place.
                7. In case any passenger feels fatigued, uncomfortable or has a cough, 
                   the same must be brought to the immediate attention of the crew so that the passenger can be taken care of.
